    %h2 About Commander.io

    :markdown
      Commander.io is a universal remote control for robots and the Internet of Things. It is a mobile app that can be used to send commands to your robots or other connected devices.

      It can communicate with any device that supports the [Common Protocol for Programming Physical I/O](http://cppp.io).

      [Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com), [Gobot](http://gobot.io) and [Artoo](https://artoo.io) are frameworks that implement an API compatible with this protocol.

      Commander is open source software developed using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). 

      You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/hybridgroup/commander) on Github. We look forward to your contributions!
